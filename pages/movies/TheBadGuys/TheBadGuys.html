              This movie was painfully predictable at almost every point. Even though i liked the styles chosen for the characters and animation I did not finish the movie because it got boring during the middle.

             I enjoy watching animated movies and wanted to give this one a watch i have to say the plot was not that great and i believe that the animation needed to be worked on longer end of it all this movie was too cliche for my liking.
