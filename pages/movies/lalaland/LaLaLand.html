              I am a HUGE fan of broadway and movie musicals of any kind and i was so excited to watch this one the aesthetics really made this movie so unique and gave it a life that is so different to other musicals. I can totally see myself watching this movie again!

              I watched this movie to see what was all the hype around it since one of my friends recommended it to me and i have to say this movie was a complete let down the film was very slow time pacing which made it feel longer than what it's supposed to be as well as shows make believe ways on achiving your dreams. 1 out of 5 stars for me.

              Murder Mystery 2 was a bit of a letdown for me. The first film was so much fun, but this one just didn't have the same magic. The plot was predictable and the jokes fell flat. I'm not sure if I'll watch the third one if they make it.

              Murder Mystery 2 was a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's not the most thought-provoking film, but it's sure to entertain you. The cast is great and the story is just enough of a mystery to keep you guessing. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the first film or anyone who just wants a fun, light-hearted comedy.

              Murder Mystery 2 was a bit of a mixed bag for me. The first half of the film was really funny, but the second half fell a bit flat. The plot was predictable and the jokes didn't land as well. Still, it was an enjoyable enough way to spend a couple of hours.
