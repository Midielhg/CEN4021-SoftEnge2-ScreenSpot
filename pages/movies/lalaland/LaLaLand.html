              I am a HUGE fan of broadway and movie musicals of any kind and i was so excited to watch this one the aesthetics really made this movie so unique and gave it a life that is so different to other musicals. I can totally see myself watching this movie again!

              I watched this movie to see what was all the hype around it since one of my friends recommended it to me and i have to say this movie was a complete let down the film was very slow time pacing which made it feel longer than what it's supposed to be as well as shows make believe ways on achiving your dreams. 1 out of 5 stars for me.

             The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as Mia and Sebastian was beautiful but i believe that their characters lacked more depth and development. Their characters seemed more archetypes rather than fully fleshed out individuals.

             Emma Stone needs her Oscar already because that performance was incredible, i could not stop smiling and even cried at the end.

              This movie ended up being too corny for my liking i am not really into sappy musical romances and this one was one of the worst ive seen so far.

              I bought a ticket to watch this movie at the theaters and i wish i could get my money back the story was boring and not creative at all. I fell asleep for half of the movie and the music was uncreative, the scenery was not awful to watch but it could have been better not watching this movie again.
